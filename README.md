To review React, I tried to use a project-based course. React has been set up using Vite. In this exercise, a timer component has been implemented using class components.

Night Mode Feature:
In this project, a Night Mode button has been added, utilizing useState and props drilling.
This feature has been thoroughly tested and allows for the toggling of classes based on changes in the component state.

Using Props, Children, and the Spread Operator:
This project utilizes props, props.children, and the spread operator (...). The props.
children feature allows you to wrap components within other components, creating a flexible and reusable structure.
The spread operator is used to pass down additional props efficiently.

Project Enhancements:
This project utilizes useContext to improve the performance of the components.
Additionally, if you click on a saved time, that time will be deleted.

old section is deleted and new section is for panel admin
and new template is ready

install React Router and define BrowserRouter in App.jsx , Routes in Content and Link in SideBar
